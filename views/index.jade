      p Hi, I'm Layne.
      p I'm a third-year Carleton student enrolled in the Honour's Computer Science program in the Software Engineering stream. I'll put some more information here.
      p I'm also minoring in history because history is cool.

        .card-body
          ul
            li Sidenav text slightly misaligned
            li Canvas input location does not scale with browser resize (much better now but still not exact)            li Mobile sidenav down-arrows wrap to next line when sliding (removed for now)
            li Sidenav container fixed so still appears if scroll right (though this should never actually happen)
            li LinkedIn link does not work as I don't have one yet
